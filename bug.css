The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of selectors and the cascade:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red;
}

#specific div {
  color: green;
}

#specific .special div {
  color: purple;
}
```

The issue lies in the unexpected behavior when all selectors are applied to the same element.  While intuitively, one might assume that the `#specific .special div` selector would override all others due to its high specificity, the cascade interacts with specificity in a way that can be counterintuitive. The order in which CSS rules appear matters, particularly in resolving specificity ties.
